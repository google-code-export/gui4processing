<h1 align="center">GUI for Processing (G4P)</h1>

<p class="style1">This project is about developing a set of 2D GUI components  (buttons, sliders, labels, text boxes etc) that can be used with all 2D  and 3D graphics modes in the Processing sketching environment (<a href="http://www.processing.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.processing.org</a>) . G4P allows you to select from a number of pre-prepared colour schemes (it is also very simple to <a href="colorscheme.html">create your own color scheme</a>) and users can specify the font type and size to be used. The transparency of any component can be changed to give some nice see through effects.</p>
<p class="style1">The  GUI components are positioned on the display using pixel coordinates. A  panel component is also available which allows other components to be  grouped. The panel can then be dragged anywhere on the screen taking  the components with it, when not required the panel can be collapsed to  a simple tab (hiding the components) so as to clear screen real estate  for the main Processing sketch. </p>
<p class="style1">Care has been taken to follow  the standard library guidelines provided by 'Processing' to ease  further development of this library. </p>

<h2 class="style1">A Little History</h2>
<p class="style1">I first came accross Processing in December 2008 and was immediately impressed with the ease of producing simple 2D and 3D animations. I particularly like the Toroid example but the inability to change the various parameters that controlled the drawing at runtime was disappointing. I decided what was needed was a set of 'simple to use' 2D GUI components.</p>
<p class="style1">I downloaded the library template, fired up Eclipse, created a code repository at GoogleCode and started programming not realising that the Processing site featured 2 such libraries already. I tried these  libraries but they didn't do everything I wanted so I decided to continue with G4P.</p>
<p class="style1">I produced a working version and there the project would  have stagnated as other matters took my attention. Then  out of the blue I get an email from Jeff, he was looking for a GUI library to work with PeasyCam, another Processing library. The main problem appeared to be combining 2D/3D graphics and since I had my GUI working fine with Toroid I was confident it would work. I made the library available and after a few problems with Java versions (my fault) Jeff was able to try it out. After many problems encountered by Jeff and code corrections by me the library is now usable and is now being made available to you.</p>
