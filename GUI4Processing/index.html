<h1 align="center">GUI for Processing (G4P)</h1>

<p class="style1">This project is about developing a set of 2D GUI components  (buttons, sliders, labels, text boxes etc) that can be used with all 2D  and 3D graphics modes in the Processing sketching environment (<a href="http://www.processing.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.processing.org</a>) . To give the GUI a consistent look it the components are drawn using a particular colour scheme. G4P has a number of pre-prepared colour schemes to choose from but it is  very simple to <a href="colorscheme.html">create your own colour scheme.</a> The user can also specify the font type and size to be used. As well as the actual colour scheme you can also <a href="compcontrol.html">control how the component is draw</a> e.g. borders, background and transparency. </p>
<p class="style1">The  GUI components are positioned on the display using pixel coordinates. A  panel component is also available which allows other components to be  grouped. The panel can then be dragged anywhere on the screen taking  the components with it, when not required the panel can be collapsed to  a simple tab (hiding the components) so as to clear screen real estate  for the main Processing sketch. </p>
<p class="style1">Care has been taken to follow  the standard library guidelines provided by 'Processing' to ease  further development of this library. </p>

    <td width="942" class="style1"> Uses the rotating toroid/helix example that comes with Processing. A Toroid class was created to hold the toriod variables and code so the main sketch creates the GUI to control the toroid. G4P controls demonstrated are the moveable/collasible panel, horizontal sliders, option buttons and checkbox. This applet demonstrates how G4P can be used to enable user input to modify options that previously had to be done in the edit window.</td>

    <td class="style1"><p>The purpose of this applet is to demonstrate the use of textfields.Text fields are useful to enter text from the user at runtime -in G4P events are generated as the user changes the text, when the &lt;Enter&gt; key is pressed and  if the program changes the displayed text. Text selection can be done with the normal keyboard shortcuts or with the mouse. G4P text fields can use the clipboard for copying and pasting and mouse selection of text.</p>

    <td class="style1">Peasycam is another third party library that provides an orbiting camera view about some 3D object(s), this program demonstrates how G4P might be used to control the rotation of  PeasyCam using G4P slider component on a moveable and collapsible panel. </td>

    <td height="114" class="style1"><a href="timer/index.html"><img src="webimages/timer.png" alt="using a timer" width="153" height="119" /></a></td>
    <td class="style1"><p>This applet demonstrates the timer component. This component allows  a user defined function (by name) to be executed at user defined intervals. In this example the function simply creates a single ball of lava to be ejected from the volcano. The slider changes the rate of ejection by altering the timer interval, while the buttons are used to start and stop the volcano.</p>
