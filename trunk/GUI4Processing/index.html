<h1 align="center">GUI for Processing (G4P)</h1>

<p class="style1">This project is about developing a set of 2D GUI components  (buttons, sliders, labels, text boxes etc) that can be used with all 2D  and 3D graphics modes in the Processing sketching environment (<a href="http://www.processing.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.processing.org</a>) . To give the GUI a consistent look it the components are drawn using a particular colour scheme. G4P has a number of pre-prepared colour schemes to choose from but it is  very simple to <a href="colorscheme.html">create your own colour scheme.</a> The user can also specify the font type and size to be used. As well as the actual colour scheme you can also <a href="compcontrol.html">control how the component is draw</a> e.g. borders, background and transparency. </p>
<p class="style1">The  GUI components are positioned on the display using pixel coordinates. A  panel component is also available which allows other components to be  grouped. The panel can then be dragged anywhere on the screen taking  the components with it, when not required the panel can be collapsed to  a simple tab (hiding the components) so as to clear screen real estate  for the main Processing sketch. </p>
<p class="style1">Care has been taken to follow  the standard library guidelines provided by 'Processing' to ease  further development of this library. </p>

    <td width="942" class="style1"> Uses the rotating toroid/helix example that comes with Processing. A Toroid class was created to hold the toriod variables and code so the main sketch creates the GUI to control the toroid. G4P controls demonstrated are the moveable/collasible panel, horizontal sliders, option buttons and checkbox. This applet demonstrates how G4P can be used to enable user input to modify options that previously had to be done in the edit window.</td>

    <td class="style1"><p>The purpose of this applet is to demonstrate the use of textfields.Text fields are useful to enter text from the user at runtime -in G4P events are generated as the user changes the text, when the &lt;Enter&gt; key is pressed and  if the program changes the displayed text. Text selection can be done with the normal keyboard shortcuts or with the mouse. G4P text fields can use the clipboard for copying and pasting and mouse selection of text.</p>

    <td class="style1"><p>This applet demonstrates the timer component. This component allows  a user defined function (by name) to be executed at user defined intervals. In this example the function simply creates a single ball of lava to be ejected from the volcano. The slider changes the rate of ejection by altering the timer interval, while the buttons are used to start and stop the volcano.</p>

    <td width="1065" class="style1"><p><a name="ogro" id="ogro"></a>This applet demonstrates how to load, display and animate MD2 models. The MD2 model format was created by Quake for it's character animations and was designed to be read by C++ programs. As Java does not support all the C++ primitive data types, writing a Java program to load these models from file was an interesting challenge. Again G4P has been used to provide a GUI to conrol the model. The models used for this applet need 1MB of memory for its data and that excludes the textures even so my 5 year old PC managed a respectable 48-52fps!</p>
      <p>Please  note that I take no credit for the actual models, they are well beyond anything I could do.</p>
    <p><strong>Please be patient as this applet will take a few moments to appear because it uses OpenGL and has to read some big files (~0.5MB)</strong></p>
    <p>ENJOY!</p>
